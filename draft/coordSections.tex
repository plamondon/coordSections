\section{Introduction}

The theory of cluster algebras gave rise to several interpretations of associahedra~\cite{Tamari, Stasheff}.
\fref{fig:associahedron} shows two such interpretations for the rank~$3$ associahedron: as the exchange graph of triangulations of a hexagon and as the exchange graph of support $\tau$-tilting modules over the cluster tilted algebra whose quiver with relations is as depicted. 
This follows from results in the setting of the ``additive categorification of cluster algebras'' that was initiated in \cite{CalderoChapotonSchiffler, BuanMarshReinekeReitenTodorov}.

\begin{figure}

	\centerline{\associahedronAccordionTikz{}\associahedronSiltingTikz{}}
	\caption{The exchange graph on triangulations of a hexagon (left) and the exchange graph on support $\tau$-tilting modules of the quiver with relations~$\overline{\quiver}$ (right).}
	\label{fig:associahedron}
\end{figure}

F.~Chapoton observed a similar isomorphism between the exchange graph of certain dissections of a heptagon and that of support $\tau$-tilting modules over the path algebra of the quiver \includegraphics[scale=.35]{relation}, subject to the relation $\beta\alpha = 0$. \fref{fig:accordiohedron} shows these two exchange graphs, which can be found in~\cite[Fig.~7]{Chapoton-quadrangulations} and in~\cite[Exm.~6.4]{AdachiIyamaReiten}.

\begin{figure}

	\caption{The $\dissection_\circ$-accordion complex of the dissection~$\dissection_\circ$ of \fref{fig:exmAccordionDissections} (left) and the $2$-term silting complex of the quiver~$\overline{\quiver}(\dissection_\circ)$ (right).}
	\label{fig:accordiohedron}
\end{figure}

The purpose of this note is to show that this isomorphism is an avatar of a more general result in the theory of $\tau$-tilting modules,
which we prove for any basic finite-dimensional algebra.

Any basic finite dimensional algebra $\Lambda$ gives rise to an exchange graph on support $\tau$-tilting modules. 
This exchange graph is the dual graph of the support $\tau$-tilting simplicial complex~\cite{AdachiIyamaReiten} (see Section~\ref{sec:recollections}).

Let~$\{e_1, \dots, e_n\}$ be a complete set of primitive pairwise orthogonal idempotents of~$\Lambda$. 
Let~$J$ be a non-empty subset of~$[n]$ and~$e_J \eqdef \sum_{j \in J} e_j$.
The following result on support $\tau$-tilting modules whose $\b{g}$-vectors vanish in certain coordinates
forms the algebraic core of the paper (See Section~\ref{sec:recollections} for definitions). 

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:mainAlgThm}
The support $\tau$-tilting complex of~$e_J \Lambda e_J$ is isomorphic to the subcomplex of the support $\tau$-tilting complex of~$\Lambda$ induced by the support $\tau$-tilting modules whose $\b{g}$-vectors' coordinates vanish outside of~$J$.
\end{theorem}

We prove Theorem \ref{thm:mainAlgThm} in Section \ref{sec:algRes}.

With this algebraic result, we can explain the isomorphism of \fref{fig:accordiohedron}, 
and extend it to dissections of any polygon.
Any reference dissection of a polygon gives rise to an exchange graph on certain dissections.
This exchange graph is the dual graph of the accordion complex studied in~\cite{Chapoton-quadrangulations, GarverMcConville, MannevillePilaud-accordion} (see Section~\ref{sec:accordions}).

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:mainDissection}
Any accordion complex is isomorphic to the support $\tau$-tilting simplicial complex of an explicit finite dimensional algebra. Thus, the corresponding exchange graphs are isomorphic.
\end{theorem}

We will deduce this result from Theorem \ref{thm:mainAlgThm} and from the known case of triangulations (or maximal dissections) of polygons.  We prove Theorem~\ref{thm:mainDissection} in Section~\ref{sec:accordions}.

\section{Recollections on $\tau$-tilting theory}
\label{sec:recollections}

\enlargethispage{.1cm}
The theory of $\tau$-tilting modules was introduced in~\cite{AdachiIyamaReiten}, and we mainly follow this source.
Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field, let $\Lambda$ be a basic finite-dimensional $k$-algebra, 
and let $\{e_1, \dots, e_n\}$ be a complete set of pairwise orthogonal idempotents in $\Lambda$.
Denote by $\MOD \Lambda$ the category of finite-dimensional right $\Lambda$-modules, 
and by $\proj \Lambda$ its full subcategory of projective modules.
We denote by $\tau$ the Auslander-Reiten translation of $\MOD \Lambda$ (see, for instance, \cite[Chapter IV]{AssemSimsonSkowronski}).
For any $\Lambda$-module $M$, we denote by $|M|$ the number of pairwise non-isomorphic direct summands appearing 
in any decomposition of $M$ into indecomposable modules.

%%%%

\subsection{Support $\tau$-tilting pairs}

Following~\cite[Def.~0.1]{AdachiIyamaReiten}, we say that a $\Lambda$-module $M$ is 
\begin{itemize}
 \item \defn{$\tau$-rigid} if $\Hom{\Lambda}(M, \tau M) = 0$;
 \item \defn{$\tau$-tilting} if it is $\tau$-rigid and $|M|=|\Lambda|$;
 \item \defn{support $\tau$-tilting} if there exists an idempotent $e$ of $\Lambda$ such that
       $e$ is in the annihilator of $M$ and $M$ is a $\tau$-tilting $\Lambda/(e)$-module.
\end{itemize}
Support $\tau$-tilting modules always exist: $\Lambda$ itself and the zero module are two examples.

It is useful to keep track of the idempotents in the annihilator of a support $\tau$-tilting module.
For this reason, we will follow~\cite[Def.~0.3]{AdachiIyamaReiten} and call a pair $(M,P)$, with $M\in \MOD \Lambda$ and $P\in \proj \Lambda$, a
\begin{itemize}
 \item \defn{$\tau$-rigid pair} if $M$ is $\tau$-rigid and $\Hom{\Lambda}(P,M) = 0$;
 \item \defn{support $\tau$-tilting pair} if it is a $\tau$-rigid pair and $|M| + |P| = |\Lambda|$;
 \item \defn{almost complete support $\tau$-tilting pair} if it is a $\tau$-rigid pair and $|M| + |P| = |\Lambda|-1$.
\end{itemize}
We will say that the pair $(M,P)$ is \defn{basic} if both $M$ and $P$ are basic $\Lambda$-modules.  
We define direct sums of pairs componentwise.

One of the main theorems of~\cite{AdachiIyamaReiten} is the following.

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Thm.~0.4]{AdachiIyamaReiten}}]
 A basic almost complete support $\tau$-tilting pair is a direct summand of exactly two basic support $\tau$-tilting pairs.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
The \defn{support $\tau$-tilting complex} of~$\Lambda$ is the simplicial complex~$\tiltingComplex(\Lambda)$ whose vertices are the isomorphism classes of indecomposable $\tau$-rigid pairs and whose faces are sets of $\tau$-rigid pairs whose direct sum is rigid.
The \defn{exchange graph}~$\stau(\Lambda)$ is the dual graph of~$\tiltingComplex(\Lambda)$, \ie the graph whose vertices are isomorphism classes of basic support $\tau$-tilting pairs, and where two vertices are joined by an edge whenever the corresponding support $\tau$-tilting pairs differ by exactly one direct summand.
\end{definition}

%%%%

\subsection{$2$-term silting objects}

The study of support $\tau$-tilting pairs turns out to be equivalent to that of another class of objects: $2$-term silting objects~\cite[Sect.~3]{AdachiIyamaReiten}.
Let $K^b(\proj \Lambda)$ be the homotopy category of bounded complexes of projective $\Lambda$-modules. 
Let $\cpx(\Lambda)$ be the full subcategory of $K^b(\proj \Lambda)$ consisting of \defn{$2$-term objects}, that is, complexes
\[
  \complexP = \cdots \to P_{m+1} \to P_m \to P_{m-1} \to \cdots
\]
such that $P_m$ is zero unless $m\in \{0,1\}$.  
We will write $P_1\to P_0$ to denote the complex
\[
\cdots \to 0 \to P_1 \to P_0 \to 0 \to \cdots
\]
A $2$-term object $\complexP$ is \defn{rigid} if $\Hom{K^b}(\complexP, \complexP[1]) = 0$.  It is \defn{silting} if
\begin{itemize}
 \item it is rigid, and 
 \item $|\complexP| = |\Lambda|$.
\end{itemize}
This is a special case of a more general definition of silting objects, see \cite{KellerVossieck}.
Examples of $2$-term silting objects include $0\to \Lambda$ and $\Lambda \to 0$.

\begin{definition}
The \defn{$2$-term silting complex} of~$\Lambda$ is the simplicial complex~$\siltingComplex(\Lambda)$ whose vertices are isomorphism classes of indecomposable rigid $2$-term objects in $K^b(\proj \Lambda)$ and whose faces are sets of such objects whose direct sum is rigid.
The \defn{exchange graph}~$\silt(\Lambda)$ is the dual graph of~$\siltingComplex(\Lambda)$, \ie the graph whose vertices are isomorphism classes of basic $2$-term silting objects in $K^b(\proj \Lambda)$, and where two vertices are joined by an edge whenever the corresponding objects differ by exactly one direct summand.
\end{definition}

For any $\Lambda$-module $M$, denote by $P_1^M\to P_0^M$ a minimal projective presentation of $M$.

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Thm.~3.2]{AdachiIyamaReiten}}]
The map $(M,P) \mapsto (P_1^M\to P_0^M) \oplus (P\to 0)$ induces an isomorphism of simplicial complexes~$\tiltingComplex(\Lambda) \cong \siltingComplex(\Lambda)$, and thus of exchange graphs~${\stau(\Lambda) \cong \silt(\Lambda)}$.
\end{theorem}

%%%%

\subsection{The $\b{g}$-vector of a $2$-term object}

The results of this note rely on the following definition.

\begin{definition}
 Let $\complexP$ be a $2$-term object in $\cpx(\Lambda)$. 
 The \defn{$\b{g}$-vector} of $\complexP$, denoted by $\b{g}(\complexP)$, is the class of $\complexP$ in the Grothendieck group $K_0\big(K^b(\proj \Lambda)\big)$.
\end{definition}
We will usually denote $\b{g}$-vectors as integer vectors by using the basis of the abelian group $K_0\big(K^b(\proj \Lambda)\big)$
given by the classes of the indecomposable projective modules $e_1 \Lambda, \dots, e_n \Lambda$ concentrated in degree $0$.
Thus, if $\complexP$ is the $2$-term object
\[
 \bigoplus_{i \in [n]} (e_i \Lambda)^{\oplus b_i} \xrightarrow{} \bigoplus_{i \in [n]} (e_i \Lambda)^{\oplus a_i},
\]
then its $\b{g}$-vector is $\b{g}(\complexP) = (a_i - b_i)_{i \in [n]}$.

In contrast to arbitrary $2$-term objects, rigid $2$-term objects are determined by their $\b{g}$-vector in the following sense.

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Sec.~2.3 \& 2.4]{DehyKeller}}]
Let $\complexP$ and $\complexQ$ be two rigid $2$-term objects. 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item If ${\b{g}(\complexP) = \b{g}(\complexQ)}$, then $\complexP$ and $\complexQ$ are isomorphic.
  
  \item The object $\complexP$ is isomorphic to an object of the form $(P_1\to P_0) \oplus (Q\stackrel{id_Q}{\to} Q)$,
    where $P_1$ and $P_0$ do not have non-zero direct summands in common.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
Note that $(Q\stackrel{id_Q}{\to} Q)$ is isomorphic to zero in $K^b(\proj \Lambda)$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Algebraic result}\label{sec:algRes}

We use the same notations as in the previous section.  In particular, $\Lambda$ is a basic finite-dimensional $k$-algebra
with complete set of pairwise orthogonal idempotents~$\{e_1, \dots, e_n\}$.

Let $J$ be a subset of $[n]$.  
We will study $2$-term objects that only involve the indecomposable projective modules $e_j \Lambda$ with $j\in J$.

\begin{definition}
Let $\cpx_J(\Lambda)$ be the full subcategory of $\cpx(\Lambda)$ whose objects are the $2$-term objects $P_1\to P_0$ such that all the indecomposable direct summands of $P_1$ and $P_0$ have the form $e_j \Lambda$ with $j\in J$.
\end{definition}

Our main interest will lie in the rigid objects in $\cpx_J(\Lambda)$.

\begin{definition}
Let~$\siltingComplex_J(\Lambda)$ be the subcomplex of~$\siltingComplex(\Lambda)$ \defn{induced} by~$J$, that is, the subcomplex whose vertices are rigid objects in $\cpx_J(\Lambda)$.
Let $\silt_J(\Lambda)$ be the dual graph of~$\siltingComplex_J(\Lambda)$.
Its vertices are isomorphism classes of basic objects $\complexP$ in $\cpx_J(\Lambda)$ satisfying
\begin{itemize}
\item $\complexP$ is rigid;
\item if $\complexP'\in \cpx_J(\Lambda)$ and $\complexP\oplus \complexP'$ is rigid, then $\complexP'$ is a direct sum of direct summands of~$\complexP$.
\end{itemize}
Two vertices are joined by an edge whenever the corresponding objects differ by exactly one indecomposable direct summand.
\end{definition}

In other words, the faces of $\siltingComplex_J(\Lambda)$ correspond to basic rigid objects whose $\b{g}$-vectors have zero coefficients in entries corresponding to elements not in $J$.
In this sense, $\siltingComplex_J(\Lambda)$ is a representation-theoretic analogue of the accordion complex~\cite{Chapoton-quadrangulations, GarverMcConville, MannevillePilaud-accordion} (see Theorem~\ref{thm:contractDiagonals}).
This is the main motivation for the introduction of this object.

Let $e_J \eqdef \sum_{j\in J} e_j$, and consider the algebra $e_J \Lambda e_J$.  
Observe that $e_J \Lambda e_J$ is isomorphic to $\End{\Lambda}(\Lambda e_J)$.  This has the following consequence.
Let $\proj_J(\Lambda)$ be the full subcategory of $\proj(\Lambda)$ whose objects are isomorphic to direct sums of
the indecomposable modules $e_j \Lambda$, with $j\in J$.

\begin{lemma}
 The $k$-linear categories $\proj_J(\Lambda)$ and $\proj(e_J\Lambda e_J)$ are equivalent.
 In particular, the categories $K^b(\proj_J(\Lambda))$ and $K^b(\proj(e_J \Lambda e_J))$ are equivalent.
\end{lemma}

This lemma immediately implies the following statement.

\begin{theorem}
The simplicial complexes~$\siltingComplex_J(\Lambda)$ and~$\siltingComplex(e_J \Lambda e_J)$ are isomorphic.
In particular, their dual graphs $\silt_J(\Lambda)$ and $\silt(e_J \Lambda e_J)$ are isomorphic.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
The simplicial complex~$\siltingComplex_J(\Lambda)$ is a pseudomanifold of dimension~$|J|-1$. In particular, its dual graph~$\silt_J(\Lambda)$ is $|J|$-regular.
\end{corollary}

\section{Application: accordion complexes of dissections}
\label{sec:accordions}

Let~$\polygon$ be a convex polygon.
We call \defn{diagonals} of~$\polygon$ the segments connecting two non-consecutive vertices of~$\polygon$.
A \defn{dissection} of~$\polygon$ is a set~$\dissection$ of non-crossing diagonals.
It dissects the polygon into \defn{cells}.
We denote by~$\overline{\quiver}(\dissection)$ the quiver with relations whose vertices are the diagonals of~$\dissection$, whose arrows connect any two counterclockwise consecutive edges of a cell of~$\dissection$, and whose relations are given by triples of counterclockwise consecutive edges of a cell of~$\dissection$.
See \fref{fig:exmAccordionDissections} for an example.

We now consider $2m$ points on the unit circle alternately colored black and white, and let~$\polygon_\circ$ (resp.~$\polygon_\bullet$) denote the convex hull of the white (resp.~black) points.
We fix an arbitrary reference dissection~$\dissection_\circ$ of~$\polygon_\circ$.
A diagonal~$\delta_\bullet$ of~$\polygon_\bullet$ is a \defn{$\dissection_\circ$-accordion diagonal} if it crosses either none or two consecutive edges of any cell of~$\dissection_\circ$.
In other words, the diagonals of~$\dissection_\circ$ crossed by~$\delta_\bullet$ together with the two boundary edges of~$\polygon_\circ$ crossed by~$\delta_\bullet$ form an accordion.
A \defn{$\dissection_\circ$-accordion dissection} is a set of non-crossing \mbox{$\dissection_\circ$-accordion} diagonals. 
See \fref{fig:exmAccordionDissections} for an example.
We call \defn{$\dissection_\circ$-accordion complex} the simplicial complex~$\accordionComplex(\dissection_\circ)$ of $\dissection_\circ$-accordion dissections.
This complex was studied in recent works of F.~Chapoton~\cite{Chapoton-quadrangulations}, A.~Garver and T.~McConville~\cite{GarverMcConville}, and T.~Manneville and V.~Pilaud~\cite{MannevillePilaud-accordion}.

\begin{figure}
	\capstart
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{exmAccordionDissections}}
	\caption{A dissection~$\dissection_\circ$ with its quiver~$\overline{\quiver}(\dissection_\circ)$ (left), a $\dissection_\circ$-accordion diagonal (middle) and a $\dissection_\circ$-accordion dissection (right).}
	\label{fig:exmAccordionDissections}
\end{figure}

For a diagonal~$\delta_\circ$ of~$\dissection_\circ$ and a $\dissection_\circ$-accordion diagonal~$\delta_\bullet$ intersecting~$\delta_\circ$, we consider the three edges (including~$\delta_\circ$) crossed by~$\delta_\bullet$ in the two cells of~$\dissection_\circ$ containing~$\delta_\circ$. We define~$\sign{\delta_\circ}{\dissection_\circ}{\delta_\bullet}$ to be $1$, $-1$, or~$0$ depending on whether these three edges form a~$\ZZZ$, a~$\SSS$, or a~$\VVV$.
The \defn{$\b{g}$-vector} of~$\delta_\bullet$ with respect to~$\dissection_\circ$ is the vector~$\gvector{\dissection_\circ}{\delta_\bullet} \in \R^{\dissection_\circ}$ whose $\delta_\circ$-coordinate is~$\sign{\delta_\circ}{\dissection_\circ}{\delta_\bullet}$.

\begin{example}
\label{exm:associahedron}
When the reference dissection~$\dissection_\circ$ is a triangulation of~$\polygon_\circ$, any diagonal of~$\polygon_\bullet$ is a $\dissection_\circ$-accordion diagonal.
The $\dissection_\circ$-accordion complex is thus an $n$-dimensional associahedron (of type~$A$), where~$n = m-3$.
As explained in \cite{CalderoChapotonSchiffler}, the $\dissection_\circ$-accordion complex is isomorphic to the $2$-term silting complex of the quiver~$\overline{\quiver}(\dissection_\circ)$ of the triangulation~$\dissection_\circ$.
The~isomorphism sends a diagonal of~$\polygon_\bullet$ to the $2$-term silting object with the same $\b{g}$-vector.
See \fref{fig:associahedron} for an illustration.
\end{example}

With the notations we introduced, we can now restate Theorem~\ref{thm:mainDissection} more precisely.

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:bijectionAccordionComplexSiltingComplex}
For any reference dissection~$\dissection_\circ$, the $\dissection_\circ$-accordion complex is isomorphic to the $2$-term silting complex of the quiver~$\overline{\quiver}(\dissection_\circ)$.
\end{theorem}

One possible approach to Theorem~\ref{thm:bijectionAccordionComplexSiltingComplex} would be to provide an explicit bijective map between $\dissection_\circ$-accordion diagonals and $2$-term silting objects for~$\overline{\quiver}(\dissection_\circ)$.
Such a map is easy to guess using \mbox{$\b{g}$-vectors}, but the proof that it is actually a bijection and that it preserves compatibility is intricate.
This approach was developed in the more general context of non-kissing complexes of gentle quivers with relations in~\cite[Proposition 4.43]{PaluPilaudPlamondon}.
In this note, we use an alternative simpler strategy to obtain Theorem~\ref{thm:bijectionAccordionComplexSiltingComplex} by using Theorem \ref{thm:mainAlgThm} and understanding accordion complexes as certain subcomplexes of the associahedron.

For that, consider two nested dissections~$\dissection_\circ \subset \dissection_\circ'$.
Observe that any~$\dissection_\circ$-accordion diagonal is a $\dissection_\circ'$-accordion diagonal.
Conversely a $\dissection_\circ'$-accordion diagonal~$\delta_\bullet$ is a $\dissection_\circ$-accordion diagonal if and only if it does not cross any diagonal~$\delta_\circ'$ of~$\dissection_\circ' \ssm \dissection_\circ$ as a $\ZZZ$ or a~$\SSS$, that is if and only if the~$\delta_\circ'$-coordinate of its $\b{g}$-vector~$\gvector{\dissection_\circ'}{\delta_\bullet}$ vanishes for any~$\delta_\circ' \in \dissection_\circ' \ssm \dissection_\circ$.
This observation shows the following statement.

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Sect.~4.2]{MannevillePilaud-accordion}}]
\label{thm:contractDiagonals}
For any two nested dissections~$\dissection_\circ \subset \dissection_\circ'$, the accordion complex~$\accordionComplex(\dissection_\circ)$ is isomorphic to the subcomplex of~$\accordionComplex(\dissection_\circ')$ induced by $\dissection_\circ'$-accordion diagonals~$\delta_\bullet$ whose $\b{g}$-vectors $\gvector{\dissection_\circ'}{\delta_\bullet}$ lie in the coordinate subspace spanned by elements in~$\dissection_\circ$.
\end{theorem}

In order to prove Theorem~\ref{thm:bijectionAccordionComplexSiltingComplex} we now turn to associative algebras.
Let~$\overline{\quiver} = (\quiver, \relations)$ be any gentle quiver with relations~\cite{ButlerRingel} and~$J$ be any subset of vertices of~$\overline{\quiver}$.
We call \defn{shortcut quiver} the quiver with relations~$\overline{\quiver}_J = (\quiver_J, \relations_J)$ whose vertices are the elements of~$J$, whose arrows are the paths in~$\overline{\quiver}$ with endpoints in~$J$ but no internal vertex in~$J$, and whose relations are inherited from those of~$\overline{\quiver}$.
Then the quotient~$k\quiver_J/\relations_J$ of the path algebra~$k\quiver_J$ is gentle and is isomorphic to the algebra~$e_J (k\quiver/\relations) \, e_J$.

\begin{example}
Quivers of dissections are shortcut quivers: if~$\dissection_\circ \subset \dissection_\circ'$, then~${\overline{\quiver}(\dissection_\circ) = \overline{\quiver}(\dissection_\circ')_{\dissection_\circ}}$.
In particular, for any dissection~$\dissection_\circ$, the quiver~$\overline{\quiver}(\dissection_\circ)$ is a shortcut quiver of the quiver with relations of a cluster tilted algebra of type~$A$.
\end{example}

The following statement is an application of Theorem~\ref{thm:mainAlgThm} to gentle algebras.

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:contractVertices}
For any gentle quiver with relations~$\overline{\quiver}$ and any subset~$J$ of vertices of~$\overline{\quiver}$, the \mbox{$2$-term} silting complex~$\siltingComplex(\overline{\quiver}_J)$ for the shortcut quiver~$\overline{\quiver}_J$ is isomorphic to the subcomplex of the $2$-term silting complex~$\siltingComplex(\overline{\quiver})$ induced by $2$-term silting objects whose $\b{g}$-vectors lie in the coordinate subspace spanned by vertices in~$J$.
\end{theorem}

Combining Theorems~\ref{thm:contractDiagonals} and~\ref{thm:contractVertices} together with Example~\ref{exm:associahedron}, we obtain Theorem~\ref{thm:bijectionAccordionComplexSiltingComplex} (and Theorem~\ref{thm:mainDissection}).

\section{Concluding remarks}

\begin{remark}
There is a geometric interpretation of the common phenomenon described in Theorems~\ref{thm:contractDiagonals} and~\ref{thm:contractVertices}.
For a $\dissection_\circ$-accordion dissection~$\dissection_\bullet$, denote by~$\R_{\ge0}\,\gvector{\dissection_\circ}{\dissection_\bullet}$ the polyhedral cone generated by the set of $\b{g}$-vectors~$\gvector{\dissection_\circ}{\dissection_\bullet} \eqdef \set{\gvector{\dissection_\circ}{\delta_\bullet}}{\delta_\bullet \in \dissection_\bullet}$. The collection~$\gvectorFan$ of cones~$\R_{\ge0}\,\gvector{\dissection_\circ}{\dissection_\bullet}$ for all $\dissection_\circ$-accordion dissections~$\dissection_\bullet$ is a complete simplicial fan called \mbox{\defn{$\b{g}$-vector fan}} of~$\dissection_\circ$~\cite{MannevillePilaud-accordion}.
The crucial feature of this fan is that no coordinate hyperplane meets the interior of any of its maximal cones.
This is often referred to as the \defn{sign-coherence property} of $\b{g}$-vectors.
It implies that for any two nested dissections~$\dissection_\circ \subset \dissection_\circ'$, the section of~$\gvectorFan[\dissection_\circ']$ with the coordinate subspace~$\R^{\dissection_\circ}$ is a subfan of~$\gvectorFan[\dissection_\circ']$.
The content of Theorem~\ref{thm:contractDiagonals} is that this subfan is the $\b{g}$-vector fan~$\gvectorFan$.
A similar statement holds for Theorem~\ref{thm:contractVertices}.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
In the theory of cluster algebras, a standard operation consists of freezing a subset of the initial cluster.
This corresponds to taking a section of the $\b{d}$-vector fan by a coordinate subspace.
To the best of our knowledge, the same operation on the $\b{g}$-vector fan studied in this note was not considered before in the literature.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
The connection between representation theory and accordion complexes was already considered by A.~Garver and T.~McConville in~\cite[Sect.~8]{GarverMcConville}.
However, their approach deals with $\b{c}$-vectors and simple-minded collections while our approach deals with $\b{g}$-vectors and silting objects.
\end{remark}
